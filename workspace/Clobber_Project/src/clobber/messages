My dad smoked his whole life. One day my mom told him "If u want to see ur children graduate, u have to stop" 3 years later he died of lung cancer. My mom told me "Dont smoke; dont put your family through this" At 24, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a sense of regret, because watching your AI play Clobber gave me cancer anyway
